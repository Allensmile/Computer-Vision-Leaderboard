# Computer-Vision-Leaderboard
The goal of this repository is:
- To keep on track of **state-of-the-art (SoTA)** on each vision task and new CNN architectures
- To see the comparison of famous CNN models at a glance (performance, speed, size, etc.)
- To access their research papers and implementations on different frameworks

## Leaderboards
From now, leaderboard is provided in the below link for better accessibility and usability.

- [ImageNet Classification Leaderboard](https://kobiso.github.io/Computer-Vision-Leaderboard/)

- To do
  - Image retrieval leaderboard

## Updates
### ImageNet Classification Leaderboard
- **181022.** Update [MnasNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626) and [Big-Little Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03848)
- **181024.** Create the [ImageNet Classification Leaderboard](https://kobiso.github.io/Computer-Vision-Leaderboard/) webpage for better accessibility and usability.
